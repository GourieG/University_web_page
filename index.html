                    <p> The 4 years that I spent at Toc H were golden. It equipped me with the great technical knowledge, leadership and analytical skills. Toc H provided me the great platform to discover myself. I was lucky to be the first batch of the college. It provided us the opportunity to explore and lay the path for others to follow. Toc H has undoubtedly the best infrastructure and  teaching staff among its peers. My mind is still afresh with the memories of the 4 years I spent there, be it the Classrooms, Labs, Sports & Arts festivals , Friendships, Hostel life or Placements it always brings back a smile on my face. Those 4 years were indeed the best days of my life.</p>
